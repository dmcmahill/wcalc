This is the windows port of the wcalc transmission line analysis/synthesis
calculator.  Please visit http://wcalc.sourceforge.net for more information
about wcalc.

The windows port makes use of GTK+ for windows.   Please visit

work of the GTK+ authors, wcalc would not exist in its current form.

The windows installer was created with NSIS.  Please visit
