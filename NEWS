Please report bugs on the sourceforge project page.

===============
Version 1.1
===============
Added self and mutual inductance of two rectangular bars.

Added coplanar waveguide model.

Added coupled stripline model.

Corrected the Q calculations for low frequency (not skindepth)
region in air core inductors.  Also corrected Q calculation for
conductors other than copper.

===============
Version 1.0
===============
Replaced the alert dialog box in the gtk version with a log
window.  This prevents a problem when many alerts are generated
and the user is presented with many many alert windows.

Added win32 support along with a build script for a windows installer.

Fixed a bug which gave lots of error/warning messages in the cgi
frontend for coupled microstrip.

===============
Version 0.9
===============
First public release.

===============
Version 0.1 
===============
Initial tagged version.  This does good analysis and synthesis
of microstrip.  Considered stable for this purpose.  However,
open/save/print and units other than mils are not supported yet.
