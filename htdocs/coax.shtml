    <P>
    Coaxial transmission lines are almost always used in a frequency
    region where only the transverse electric magnetic (TEM) mode will
    propagate.  Several texts give an approximate formula for the
    cutoff frequency for the lowest order TE mode but most do not
    provide details on the exact calculation.  The general solution
    can be found by following the texts on circular waveguides but
    recognizing that we have a boundary condition imposed by the
    center conductor which is different than the boundary condition
    imposed by a hollow pipe.  Wcalc uses a numerical iteration to
    find the constants which satisfy the boundary conditions to in
    theory provide an exact solution.

        <LI>The TE10 cutoff calculation is based on c=0 (center
    conductor is not offset from center).  If anyone cares to offer a
    suggestion on how to solve for the TE10 cutoff frequency when c is
    not zero, please let me know.
