    <H2>Overview</H2>
    <p>
    Wcalc is a tool for the analysis and synthesis of transmission line structures and 
    related components.  Wcalc provides the ability to analyze the electrical parameters
    of a particular structure based on the physical dimensions and material parameters.
    The synthesis portion calculates the required physical parameters to meet desired
    electrical specifications.  Wcalc includes several models and places an emphasis on
    accuracy.  Several frontends provide the user with several options for its use.
    </p>

    <H2>History</H2>
    <p>
    Work on Wcalc was started in 1997 as part of a RF and microwave
    filter design toolkit.  During the initial work on that program
    (no the filter toolkit is not currently available), it quickly
    became apparent that 
    an essential piece of that tool was a microstrip transmission line
    synthesis routine.  Considerable time was spent researching the
    available approximations for microstrip analysis with the goal of
    implementing the most accurate approximations.  The result of that
    early work was a JavaScript based analysis/synthesis tool.  The
    JavaScript based
    tool is still available under the name <a
    href="http://mcalc.sourceforge.net">mcalc</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some of the lessons learned when writing <a
    href="http://mcalc.sourceforge.net">mcalc</a> are:  I don't like
    programming in JavaScript, sometimes I don't have access to a
    JavaScript enabled web browser at the computer I'm in front of (at
    least I didn't in 1997, now in 2009 that is no longer an issue),
    and sometimes the simple calculator based frontend to the
    numerical routines is simply not enough.  These considerations led
    to the decision to create a tool with the flexibility to support
    several frontends in a way that makes the addition of new models
    relatively straightforward.
    </p>

    <H2>Frontends</H2>
    <p>
    At this time, Wcalc includes 6 frontends to the numerical
    routines.  A CGI interface provides a simple way to provide, for
    example, company-wide access to the calculators via an intranet.
    The <a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+</a> based graphical user
    interface is the standard standalone version of Wcalc.  Through
    the mex interface, users can use
    <a href="http://www.scilab.org/">Scilab</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.octave.org/">Octave</a>, or
    <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">Matlab</a> for a high
    powered programming interface to Wcalc.  Finally, a minimal
    standard input/output interface provides a means for interfacing
    to 3rd party tools which support inter-process communication
    (IPC).
