    <H2>Can I run wcalc on my favorite operating system?</H2>
    <p>
	Wcalc is primarily developed under <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>,
	but should be easily compiled on most major unix-like
	operating systems.  A compile or run time failure of wcalc on
	Linux, *BSD, or OSX, or Solaris is considered to be a high priority
	bug.  While I am interested in making sure wcalc also works
	under other unix-like operating systems, I have very limited
	access to them for testing.  In
	addition, it is possible to compile Wcalc as a native windows application
	using <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>.
    </p>

    <H2>Why don't you distribute binaries for my favorite operating system?</H2>
    <p>
	I don't have the resources to provide precompiled binaries for many 
	different operating systems.  Most Linux distributions and all
	of the BSD operating systems 
	have native packaging systems that would be the appropriate place for
	binaries.  I do, however, provide a windows installer.  This is in
	recognition of the fact that it is far more common for a windows machine
	to not have any development tools on it than for a Linux or BSD system.

    <H2>I can't get the matlab interface to work on my computer!</H2>
    <p>
    Due to the high cost of Matlab, I have a very limited access to systems where
    I can test <a href="mex-wcalc.html">MEX-Wcalc</a>.  Please report exactly what
    system you have, the matlab version, and the exact errors.
    Patches are always welcome!  Please submit bug reports and patches at the
    <A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/wcalc">Wcalc Sourceforge Project Page</A>.
    </p>

    <H2>Where can I report bugs?</H2>
    <p>
    Please submit bug reports and patches at the
    <A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/wcalc">Wcalc Sourceforge Project Page</A>.
    When you do file a bug report, the following information is required for me to be able
    to do anything useful:
	<ul>
	  <li>wcalc version</li>
	  <li>operating system and version.  If it is a unix-like
    operating system, <tt>uname -a</tt> is often times helpful.</li>
          <li><em>Exact</em> arguments given to the <tt>configure</tt>
    script if you built from sources.</li>
          <li>Which compiler and compiler version if you built from
    sources.  If you are using the GNU compiler (gcc), which is the
    most common case, you can find the version with <tt>gcc
    --version</tt>.</li>
          <li>How to reproduce the problem.</li>
          <li>If the program produces an output that you believe to be
    incorrect, please say what the correct output should be and
    provide a reference.  Many of the calculations used by wcalc are
    approximate because no exact closed form solution is known.  In
    addition, my experience has been that many of the published works
    contain typographical errors.  I have corrected as many as
    possible, but currently I do not have a good electromagnetic field
    solver tool to use as a means for validating my implementations.</li>
	</ul>
    Any bug report that simply says "program not work" will be ignored.
    </p>

    <H2>Wcalc is awesome.  Why is it free?</H2>
    <p>
    There is a lot of very good free software available.  In particular, the 
    <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD operating system</a> that my computer runs
    is free, the <a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+ toolkit</a> used by the graphical
    interface, and <a href="http://www.scilab.org">Scilab</a> and <a href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a>
    which provide a programming frontend are free.  Given the benefit I have received
    from using all of these free tools, it seemed appropriate to give something back.
    Besides, Wcalc has been a hobby project of mine and it pleases me to know that
    others find it useful.
