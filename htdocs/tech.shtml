	The models used by Wcalc are either closed form or psuedo-closed form
	models.  In cases where an exact solution of the electromagnetic fields
	exists, for example in the coaxial transmission line or infinitely thin conductor stripline
	case both with ideal conductors, then the exact solution is used.  In all
	other cases, various approximate solutions have been applied.
    </P>
    <P>
	Many of the approximate solutions (found in the literature, not developed by
	the Wcalc author) have been developed by optimizing an approximating
	function to match a reference value obtained through exhaustive numerical 
	solutions to Maxwell's equations.  The approximating functions are typically
	chosen so they approach known analytic solutions in extreme cases.  These 
	models are typically much much to complex for manually applying with a hand
	calculator but are trivially simple for a modern or even not so modern computer
	to solve.  This makes Wcalc be very fast.  In many cases the error in the
	approximation is less than the error due to physical tolerances.  However,
	one should heed any warnings issued to Wcalc when physical dimensions are
	outside the usual range for accuracy.

      The transmission line structures analyzed by Wcalc currently are
      all either transverse electromagnetic (TEM) or quasi-TEM lines
      and are modeled by the incremental circuit model shown below.

      Before applying this model, it is important to understand some
    of the limitations.  In general, the equations for characteristic
    impedance and velocity are derived assuming perfect conductors
    (resistivity of the material is zero).  Then conductor loss is
    added with the assumption that the fields are not significantly
    changed by the finite conductance of the metal.  
    </P>
    <P>
      This approach works well for the capacitance per length of line
      calculation.  This is because when a static potential is applied
      to the line, there is no current flow in the x or y directions.
      We are assuming that the line is uniform in the
      z-direction so that the x-y geometry fully specifies the line
      cross section.  The implication of this is that the microstrip
      model or coupled microstrip model can accurately predict
      capacitance of circuit board traces at low frequencies.
    </P>
    <P>
      Inductance calculations, in contrast to capacitance
      calculations, are a bit more complex.  Consider the case of the
      coaxial transmission line shown below.

      The standard analysis found in text books assumes that the
    current flows in an infinitely thin sheet at the surface of the
    conductors.  Ampere's law tells us that the magnetic fields are
    confined to the dielectric layer in between and the calculation of
    inductance yields the usual inductance per length for coax.  This
    inductance per length may be calculated directly using the
    quasi-static fields or by calculating capacitance and finding the
    inductance from the capacitance and velocity of a TEM line.
    </P>
    <P>
      At low frequencies, the inductance found based on TEM transmission
      line models becomes incorrect.  This is because at low
      frequencies, the current is not confined to a thin sheet at the
      conductor surfaces but rather is distributed across the
      conductor.  This modifies the magnetic fields and changes the
      inductance.  Currently Wcalc does not do anything to account for
      this effect.  If you are designing circuits where you plan on
      doing things like using a short (compared to 1/4 wavelength)
      line as an inductor, you must be concerned with this effect.
      The good news is that the quality factor of the inductance
      formed by a line at low frequencies is usually low enough to
      discourage its use anyway.
