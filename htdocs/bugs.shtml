    <H2>Bug Reporting</H2>
    <P>While I have tried my best to ensure that Wcalc is a high quality program,
    there are bound to be some bugs.  I rely on you, the user, to help me out by
    reporting them.  Please report all bugs on the <A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/wcalc">Wcalc
    Sourceforge Project Page</A>.  Please be sure to include the following information
    in your bug report:
    <UL>
    <LI>Wcalc version</LI>
    <LI>Operating system</LI>
    <LI>Operating system version</LI>
    <LI>Compiler and version</LI>
    <LI>How to reproduce the bug</LI>
    <LI>Anything else that you feel may be relevant to the bug</LI>
    </UL>
    In addition, it is useful to me to have a way of contacting you to try out a
    possible fix or if I need more information.
    </P>
    <P>
    Reporting bugs on the <A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/wcalc">Wcalc Sourceforge Project Page</A>,
    causes them to go into a bug database ensuring that they don't get lost in all the spam which
    fills my inbox.
    </P>
    <P>
    Please remember that this is a hobby project which I support in my limited free time.  I may 
    fix a bug right away, but sometimes other responsibilities take priority.  I will eventually
    get to them though.
    </P>

    <H2>Mailing Lists and Other Support</H2>
    <P>The <A HREF="http://www.geda.seul.org">gEDA</A> project
      maintains several 
      <A
	 HREF="http://www.geda.seul.org/mailinglist/index.html">mailing lists</A>
      which are a good place to ask questions about Wcalc.  Please put bug reports in the
      official database though or they are likely to get lost.
    </P>

    <H2>New Models</H2>
    <P>I am always interested in adding new models and improving the existing models.
    It is very helpful to me to have references for any new model suggestions.  Researching
    the best models is often times the most difficult part of adding
    another model.  You are much more likely to convince me to add a
    model if you can provide the reference and convince me that it
    is a good one.
    </P>
