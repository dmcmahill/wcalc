    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="wcalc-1.0">wcalc-1.0 released</A></H2>
    <P>
    This release contains a few minor bug fixes and improvements over
    version 0.9.  In particular, the GTK frontend now uses a log window
    for warnings instead of a single dialog box per warning.  The CGI
    frontend for coupled microstrip now does not generated lots of warning
    messages.  Finally, win32 support is added and a build script is added
    to allow native windows installers to be generated.
    </P>

    <P>
    After 8 years in development and use among a fairly small group of people,
    I am pleased to announce that the first public release of wcalc is finally
    available.  While wcalc is believed to be stable at this time, it has not
    received much field testing.  Therefore I decided on calling this version
    0.9.  My intention is to collect feedback from users over the next few months
    and then make a 1.0 release after wcalc has seen some more widespread use.
