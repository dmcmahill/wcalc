Garg_and_Bahl_MTT-27.pdf
------------------------
Ramesh Garg and I. J. Bahl, "Characteristics of Coupled Microstriplines",
IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. MTT-27, No. 7,
July 1979.

Has some simplified equations for coupled microstrip impedance.  Of
more importance is the loss calculations.  They use Wheeler's incremental
inductance method applied to the closed form expressions for impedance
to come up with some closed form expressions for conductor loss.
They compare to Rao who did not include loss in the ground plane.  The
dielectric loss reported here is referenced as coming from Rao.

exact case of an infinitely thin strip and approximate formulas for
non-zero strip thickness.
