--------------------
Steve Deibele and James B. Beyer, "Measurements of Microstrip Effective
Relative Permittivities", IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and
Techniques, Vol. MTT-35, No. 5, May 1987.

Compares measured effective permitivities of microstrip to the predicted
values using the formulations of Hammerstad and Jensen and that of
Kirschning and Jansen.

---------
Application note from Rogers Corp. regarding single microstrip.
Uses Hammerstad and Jensen's impedance expression and the Kirschning
and Jansen dispersion expressions.
