- finish spanish translation for gtk-wcalc

- testing!

- find a good way to add regression tests to the octave/matlab/scilab
  frontend

- find a good way to add regression tests to the cgi frontend

- come up with an "acceptance" plan for doing quality control on the gtk
  frontend.

- Air Coil.  Read RF Design, Jan 1998 and Applied Microwave & Wireless, 
  Nov/Dec 1997 for transmission line based model for helical coils.
  Maybe get a better Q/SRF prediction? 

- Improve the coplanar waveguide model.  The model from Wadell's book
  has been implemented and compared to HP's AppCAD, but HP doesn't give
  a reference.  

- Research and add spiral inductors with the ability to write out a fasthenry
  model.  Would be neat to be able to write out a layout as well.  Maybe in
  stream format for IC and pcb format for boards?  

- End correction for stripline?

- End correction for coax?

- Maybe start adding filter toolbox stuff here?

- Better checking of inputs to avoid problems when someone asks for
  900 GHz calculations or other sillyness.

- rework the  coax, and ic_microstrip gtk frontends to use
  x,y variables to keep track of the position of widgets in the table.
  This will make form modifications much easier.  The other gtk frontends
  are ok already.

- Add the ability to write out a fasthenry model for some of the structures.

- Figure out how to use LC (finite difference time domain, FDTD, electromagnetic
  simulator) and script it to be able to generate some plots of impedance and
  loss for various structues.  This would provide the basis for some accuracy
  checking of wcalc.   Also have wcalc spit out input files for LC or other
  E&M tools.  

- Add the ability to write out a LC (lc.cray.com) model for the structures.

- On the coupled stripline model, make it behave better in the face of some of the 
  more advanced geometries found in MCM substrates and the like.
