- finish spanish translation for gtk-wcalc

- testing!

- find a good way to add regression tests to the octave/matlab/scilab
  frontend

- find a good way to add regression tests to the cgi frontend

- come up with an "acceptance" plan for doing quality control on the gtk
  frontend.

- Air Coil.  Read RF Design, Jan 1998 and Applied Microwave & Wireless, 
  Nov/Dec 1997 for transmission line based model for helical coils.
  Maybe get a better Q/SRF prediction? 

- Research and add coplanar waveguide

- Research and add spiral inductors with the ability to write out a fasthenry
  model

- End correction for stripline?

- End correction for coax?

- Maybe start adding filter toolbox stuff here?

- Better checking of inputs to avoid problems when someone asks for
  900 GHz calculations or other sillyness.

- rework the air_coil, coax, and ic_microstrip gtk frontends to use
  x,y variables to keep track of the position of widgets in the table.
  This will make form modifications much easier.  The other gtk frontends
  are ok already.
