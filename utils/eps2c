# This script operates on an EPS file to produce a C program which
# will print the EPS file along with some surrounding stuff to handle
# the bounding box and properly enclose the EPS file.
#
#
# Typical usage would be:
#
#    eps2c fname=print_ps foo.eps > foo.c
#
# The generated C code will be a function
#
# void print_ps(FILE *);
