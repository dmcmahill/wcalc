WARNING:  This is not finished yet....  But it needs to be so I can
have a cleaner way to add new models.


This file tries to document the procedure for adding a new model
to the program.

Each structure should have three files.  We will use microstrip as
the example.

microstrip.c	 =  GUI independent file which contains all of the
		    model information and equations.

microstrip_gui.c =  file which contains the methods to interface the
		    main program to the microstrip calculations.

microstrip_loadsave.c =  file which contains the function to load/save
			 microstrip data from/to files.


The microstrip_gui.{c,h} should define an object of type
'microstrip_gui' that provides the following methods:

->load(FILE*)		loads the data from a file.
->save(FILE*)		saves the data to a file.
->analyze(void)		performs an analysis
->synthesize(void)	performs a synthesis
->display(void)		updates the display
